#DML:
drop table if exists workspace;

create table workspace (workspaceId int, FolderPath varchar(max));

insert into workspace values (1,'a\b\c')

insert into workspace values (1,'a\d')

insert into workspace values (1,'a\e')

insert into workspace values (1,'a\b\a')

insert into workspace values (1,'a\a\a')

insert into workspace values (1,'b')

insert into workspace values (1,'c')

insert into workspace values (1,'c\d\e')

insert into workspace values (1,'a\b\c\d')


#Solution:
with cte as (select FolderPath,ROW_NUMBER()over(order by FolderPath) as rn from workspace)

select FolderPath,count(value) as Value
from cte
cross apply string_split(FolderPath,'\')
group by FolderPath
