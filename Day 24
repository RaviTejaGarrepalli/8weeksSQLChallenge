--Find the Numbers who are Consecutively repeating 3 times in a row-----

CREATE TABLE series1 (
 id INT PRIMARY KEY,
 num INT
);
INSERT INTO Series1 values( 
1, 1),
(2, 1),
(3, 1),
(4, 2),
(5, 1),
(6, 2),
(7, 2);

##Solution
with cte as (select *,id-dense_rank()over(partition by num order by id ) as rnk from series1),

cte2 as (select id,count(*)over (partition  by num,rnk) as cnt
from cte )

select id 
from cte2
where cnt=3
