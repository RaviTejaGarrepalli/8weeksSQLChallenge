Problem
Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than 1000$.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.
Return the result table in any order. Round the salary to the nearest integer.


# Solution
with cte as (select company_id,max(salary) as Max_Salary from Salaries
group by company_id)

select Salaries.*,cte.Max_Salary,Round((case when cte.Max_Salary<1000 then 0
when cte.Max_Salary between 1000 and 10000 then (Salaries.salary)*(1-0.24)
when cte.Max_Salary >10000 then (Salaries.salary)*(1-0.49)
END),0) as Tax
from Salaries 
inner join cte on Salaries.company_id=cte.company_id
